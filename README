 This README is pretty small, since the project is pretty small. The files
 included with the help generator are from the Boost help v1.54 (complete)
 and are subject to their own licenses (see LICENSE_1_0.txt in this direct
 ory).

 Though binaries would have made the generator more 


 The files that belong to the help generator are listed below.

  File                           Purpose
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	autoimportrc                   Configuration file for autoimport.sh. Contains files to be moved out of tree when importing.
	autoimport.sh                  Creates the necessary links needed to fully build your currently installed
																 documentation. It works best if you've installed it with dpkg. But will
																 also look for it in other locations.
	                               that the qhelpcompiler cannot handle without errors (which is usually
																 the case).
	boost.css                      Part of the boost documentation tree																 
	boostdoc-qch-doc.sha					 SHA512 verification file used for validating the source files (changes when source changes)
	boostdoc-qch-doc.uuid					 UUID file used to identify the project root directory (this does not change)
	boost.qch											 (Generated) The final output, help file used for Qt-Creator
	boost.qhp											 (Generated) Used by make and qhelpgenerator to build the helpfile
	boost.qhpsrc									 Boilerplate chunks used to create the qhp file above (dont edit this!) 
	BUGS													 List of known limitations, bugs, or shortcomings in this project
	COMPILING											 Instructions on how to create the boost.qch, the purpose of the project
	files.list										 (Generated) Used by make via make-boost-qhp.sh 
	files-unformatted.list				 0.0.2: generated by make via generatesections.sh (this and the previous
																 files.list are generated by generatelists.sh)
																 0.0.2-final: no longer used by the above, but will be used for keyword
																 indexing, or maybe even filtering if that comes along in 0.0.3 or 4
  full-documentation.qch		     For people who only want to get their hands on the final product, the qch and
	                               do not wish to build a custom one from their installed libaries. Many novice
																 and beginners will probably want just this file. It was compiled from the ENTIRE
																 boost library 1.54, and has been verified 100% stable. The files generated by
																 make no longer are part of the source tree so use this if you want just the final product.
	generatelists.sh							 Used by make to generate the files.list and files-unformatted.list. Uses
																 the files to make the qhp project file and for the generatesections.sh
	generatesections.offline       Parts of generatesections.sh that will be used later but not right now.
	generatesections.sh						 Used by make to generate the sections used to make the qhp project file
																 The time this takes to build can vary depending on how much of the boost
																 documentation that you are committing to the build, in 0.0.1 this file
																 does not yet perform any actions.
	generatesections.smell         Annotations made in generatelists.sh are here.
 
  File													 Purpose
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  HISTORY												 History of previous versions, commits, or releases.
	LICENSE												 The license, it applies only to the project files listed here.
	make-boost-qhp.sh							 Used by make to create the qhp project file
	Makefile											 Used by make to run all other scripts that ultimately create the final
																 output file (boost.qch).
  .mirrorcopy (generated)        Tag created by autoimport.sh to identify the directory as a mirrored
									               copy. Essential for autoimport.sh to operate properly.
	mirror.sh                      Creates a local, mirrored copy of the current tree as a sibling to the
																 current directory. The directory name is always 'boostdoc-mirror-xxx' 
																 where 'xxx' is a 3-digit alphanumeric code generated by tempfile and is
																 guaranteed unique. Read the comments in mirror.sh for details.
  .originals                     This is where autoimport.sh stores files included in the source tree
	                               but have been imported over from a newer documentation. This is used
																 by the --undo feature of autoimport.sh.
	README												 A short description of the project & files, plus any other notables
	rst.css                        Part of the boost documentation tree.
	sections.list									 (Generated) Used by make-boost-qhp to build the qhp project file (generated
																 by generatesections.sh)
	tags													 Used for functional reference by the vim editor for the development of the
																 scripts. This file mainly tracks the functions of generatesections.sh.

  File													 Purpose
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
	unique.list,
	sections.list.(pre|pre2)       (Intermediate Generated) These files are created and (under normal circumst-
																 ances) destroyed during compilation. If you see any packaged with the actual
																 repository or snapshots, please let the author know as soon as possible.
	files.unformatted.list.(preX)	 (IG) Same as above.																 

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Version Notes (so important that they are listed here instead of in HISTORY)

  0.0.3-dev    -- looks like development will continue until past July 4th, setting a new date for 
									July 7th. Releases will now come on a 2-week interval until 0.0.6 at least. They will
									slow down to month-to-month, and slower as the project approaches v1.0.0-stable (final).
									(This does not necessarily mean that we will have to go through 99 stable versions before
									final, we'll just have to see where we are as we make that approach).

  0.0.2-stable -- the documentation of boost-1.54 has been downsized to include only part of it, just enough 
	                so you can build a working copy. You can use the provided autoimport.sh to do this, it will
									locate (via dpkg, guessing, etc), and create the needed links to your existing documentation.
									If your documentation lies on a slower medium or across a network, you will want to use the
									supplied mirror.sh script AFTER (not before) using autoimport.sh. This will allow you to have
									a local working copy of both the source and tree. The script will spawn a new shell which will
									(unless you picked 'Preserve') delete the mirrored copy after you exit that shell. Take care
									to copy your newly created boostdoc.qch into a FINAL DIRECTORY before exiting or your file will
									be deleted too!

									 ubuntu@localhost /src/boostdoc $ ./autoimport.sh <ENTER>

									will do the jobs for you, its just an ease of use tool that will do the work of finding and
									copying your whole boost documentation. It can be done by default before building, see
									COMPILING for more information on building.

 Usage

 	The qch comes pre-compiled and ready to use. If you need to rebuild the files, please read COMPILING.

 Installation

  Throw that qch file in any old directory you want. Then use Qt Creator or Qt Assistant and add it to your
	list of help collections. That's about it.

 Notes
   Though only a small part of the documentation is in the source tree, this tree does come with
	 a COMPLETE compilation of the ENTIRE boost documentation tree version 1.54, it is in ./boostdoc.qch.
   If you run make clean/make, then you will lose this file, to reget it, use git clone again and the
	 file will be restored.

	Please read the file "COMPILING" for how information on building.
