 This README is pretty small, since the project is pretty small. The files
 included with the help generator are from the Boost help v1.54 (complete)
 and are subject to their own licenses (see LICENSE_1_0.txt in this direct
 ory).

 The files that belong to the help generator are listed below.

  File                           Purpose

	boost.qch											 (Generated) The final output, help file used for Qt-Creator
	boost.qhp											 (Generated) Used by make and qhelpgenerator to build the helpfile
	boost.qhpsrc									 Boilerplate chunks used to create the qhp file above (dont edit this!) 
	BUGS													 List of known limitations, bugs, or shortcomings in this project
	COMPILING											 Instructions on how to create the boost.qch, the purpose of the project
	files.list										 (Generated) Used by make via make-boost-qhp.sh 
	files-unformatted.list				 (Generated) Used by make via generatesections.sh (this and the previous
																 files.list are generated by generatelists.sh)
	generatelists.sh							 Used by make to generate the files.list and files-unformatted.list. Uses
																 the files to make the qhp project file and for the generatesections.sh
	generatesections.sh						 Used by make to generate the sections used to make the qhp project file
	HISTORY												 History of previous versions, commits, or releases
	LICENSE												 The license, it applies only to the project files listed here
	make-boost-qhp.sh							 Used by make to create the qhp project file
	Makefile											 Used by make to run all other scripts that ultimately create the final
																 output file (boost.qch).
	README												 A short description of the project & files, plus any other notables
	rewrite-link									 (Not Used) Used by rewritelinks, operates on a single file
	rewritelinks					   	     (Not Used) Provided as a template to rewrite links if you need to do this
	                               you should know why and edit the rewrite-link to work the way you want it
																 to. The default is to strip out ../../ references. This is only useful when
																 making a qch file that includes only part of the documentation (providing 
																 that you moved the structure down).
	sections.list									 (Generated) Used by make-boost-qhp to build the qhp project file (generated
																 by generatesections.sh)

 Usage

 	The qch comes pre-compiled and ready to use. If you need to rebuild the files, please read COMPILING.

 Installation

  Throw that qch file in any old directory you want. Then use Qt Creator or Qt Assistant and add it to your
	list of help collections. That's about it.

 Notes

	Future versions of the boost documentation can be generated just as easily, just copy the contents of the
	'doc' folder into the root along with all it's subdirectories. See COMPILING for how to rebuild.
