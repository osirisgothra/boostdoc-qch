Proposed Test List

  This is a collection of the  most  trouble-bearing  directories that
I  have  found  so  far in the boost documentation.  The way I see it,
they are the  best suited for testing purposes and  will  be  included
as part of  the 'test  documentation'  along  with the project.  Prior 
to this time,  only  part of  the 'docs'  subdirectory  was  provided, 
however it seems to be insuffiecient as it has mostly  'very friendly'
resources.

  The  following list  contains the resources best suited for the test
inclusion of the project.  They are ordered by their date-of-inclusion
(or 'doi'), descending order. These files/directories will be included
from version  0.0.4-experimental (0.0.3-stable) and forward. This list
list  may  change  when testing with  1.54 is complete and moves on to
test later versions (1.55, etc). Please note that empty column entries
are meant to mean the same as the column entry before it. The list  is
as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 doi			directory (based at HEAD)				reason for inclusion (initial)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
17-7-14		doc/html/boost_asio/reference   empty entries turning up
          libs/ptr_container
          libs/bind                       out-of-root redirected index*
					libs/circular_buffer            
					libs/config
					libs/conversion
					libs/geometry
					more
					tools
					libs/heap                       redirector to different root**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------			
 dor      directory (based at HEAD)       reason for removal 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
17-7-14   doc														  removed pending the new inclu-
                                          sions above
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*  a directory that has no html content, but contains some, so uses the 
   nearest index it can find, which happens to be a redirector to another
	 file which is also not in the source directory
** a directory containing (usually) a single index document, which is a
   redirector to another, multi-documented part of the tree, usually when
	 the documentation for libraries placed into a common /doc root.
	 (ie: /libs/somedir/index.html -> /doc/samelib/index.html)
