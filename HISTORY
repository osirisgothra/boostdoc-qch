 June 15, 2014 - Version 0.0.1
 -----------------------------
 Experimental Phase
 ------------------
 0.0.1 - 6-15-14 - Initial Project Creation
 0.0.1 - 6-16-14 - First Test - Works (but without images and some missing links) but not all content files included
 0.0.1 - 6-17-14 - Test - Works with all images/links included + content (no keywords or filters planned yet)
 0.0.1 - 6-17-14 - Ready for first stable version proceeding last successful test

 Stable Phase
 ------------------
 0.0.1 - 6-17-14 : Promoted to STABLE status 

 June 18, 2014 - Version 0.0.2
 -----------------------------
 Experimental Phase
 ------------------
 0.0.2 - 6-18-14 - New branch created and wiki updated to show how version system works, HISTORY, BUGS, README, etc are created
 0.0.2 - 6-18-14 - Tests commencing for entire day, targeting Friday June 20 2014 for stable release status day (hopefully)
 0.0.2 - 6-19-14 - Testing (section generation generatesections)
 0.0.2 - 6-20-14 - Problems with xml validation and certain files in the boost library that have PHP integrated in the titles slow progress, new target 6-24-14
 0.0.2 - 6-21-14 - Scrapped original generatesections.sh, which worked with the file lists to generate and went back to off-machine design (paper + pencil)
 0.0.2 - 6-22-14 - The day was dedicated to the modular design and flowcharting the process, determined that dirwalking was far more stable than list walking
 0.0.2 - 6-23-14 - Applied concepts and design to new script, final testing phase succeeded, removed 80% of included documentation for speeding up tests for 6-24 release
 
 Stable Phase
 -----------------
 0.0.2 - 6-23-14 - After succeeding in compiling a working qch with contents, despite some issues (see BUGS), this version is deemed stable and the branch is solidified to release
 0.0.2 - 6-24-14 - fixed two bad date entries in HISTORY (was 6-24 and 6-25, supposed to be 6-23 and 6-24)

 June 24, 2014 - Version 0.0.3
 -----------------------------
 Experimental Phase
 ------------------
 0.0.3 - 7-14-14 - Back to it, added meta-refresh handlers and indexes/titles for ALL directories is complete. Added title xml codec script to handle
                   the flaky HTML that is laxed out in some of the files.
				 7-17-14 - Finished compiling a stable copy of the help document (had to polish but it was 99% good). The most recent will always be included
				             in the source tree as full-documentation.qch (so it doesnt get overwritten). Also, pre-generated files are NO LONGER supplied. You
									   MUST build them  yourself (see COMPILING). 
									 Made all config files (autoimport.rc, etc) have the .rc extension for proper reading in vim, they also have a somewhat limited
									   syntax capability (blanks ignored, comment lines starting with //), each file explains what is done therein.
									 Added ALL W3C HTML 4.01 symbols to the list (not that everyone is using them properly in boost). It is used mainly after the
									   codec script (see next comment).
									 (re)Added codec script, getent.pl. It will pull, decode, and re-encode HTML strings to be 100% proper. After which, the gensec
									   script will 'cook' the text into pure XML-compliant entities using the symbol table previously mentioned (250+ symbols).
									 REMOVED all the old boost documentation previously included in earlier builds. Only "TEST" documentation is included. Which is
									   stuff that tends to cause the most trouble. This is done because a full build takes up to 30 minutes, which is bad when doing
										 development. 'Naughty' pages are few and far between. I have identified those pages in proposed-test-list and imported their
										 branches as part of the test tree. YOU WILL NEED TO USE THE AUTOIMPORT SCRIPT TO ACTUALLY BUILD A WORKING COPY FROM NOW ON!!
										 (you will be warned by the make script before starting).
 0.0.3 - 6-30-14 - Much more work and much less time pave the way for problems, read the README for details on that.
 0.0.3 - 6-24-14 - In this phase, targeting to polish what needs done, not just in BUGS list but also adding of KEYWORDS and (possibly) even FILTERS
 0.0.3 - 6-24-14 - Added import and mirror scripts. Signed project with a UUID, and secured readonly data (including UUID) with a sha256 checksum file  
                   Please note that the LICENSE is also hashed, to prevent accidental (or deliberate third party) modifications to the license.
									 Furthermore, only the LICENSE file should be considered, the other license headers (in varied files) are just there for reference
									 so you dont have to open LICENSE each time to read it. However, LICENSE is the legally applicable source in any circumstance, so
									 that is why it is protected with the SHA signature (it would be too much of a headache to do partial checksums for all license headers)
									 I *may* choose to remove the license headers later on, if need be. I should say *probably*.
 0.0.3 - 6-24-14 - Breaking from direct work on project in order to schedule 0.0.3's development cycle, and the when and where of it. This usually takes
 									 most of the day so I dont anticipate much actual project changes today (in exception to the ones made this morning, see above).
 0.0.3 - 6-25-14 - After a careful check for design issues that might affect the project, ive created the mirror system that will allow expidited testing
                   without messing up the tree (or git). This is done outside of git so i can test things that might hurt the tree without actually doing it
									 and since the scripts are symlinks, my changes to them will stick (unless ro is selected). 
								 - Finished the autoimport and autoimport --undo features, you can now use your own boost documentation although I leave this pretty small 
								   part of it just so you can get the gist of where it's supposed to go. I may be removing it by 0.0.5, once the groundwork is done.
                 - Today will be used to address the various issues in the documentation tree: The empty sections, the files that have <meta refresh> tags,
								   and the empty intermediate directories with non-empty children. These i think make the documentation a little confusing for some. Also,
									 the first index page is still showing as an absolute path, fixing that as well. It could be a couple days depending on how much time I
									 have to dedicate to this project. 
								 - Updated the Start date for 0.0.3 to June 24, not 25th.
								 - Target stable release dates established: 0.0.3-stable scheduled for June 30th, 2014
