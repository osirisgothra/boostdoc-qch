 June 15, 2014 - Version 0.0.1
 -----------------------------
 Experimental Phase
 ------------------
 0.0.1 - 6-15-14 - Initial Project Creation
 0.0.1 - 6-16-14 - First Test - Works (but without images and some missing links) but not all content files included
 0.0.1 - 6-17-14 - Test - Works with all images/links included + content (no keywords or filters planned yet)
 0.0.1 - 6-17-14 - Ready for first stable version proceeding last successful test

 Stable Phase
 ------------------
 0.0.1 - 6-17-14 : Promoted to STABLE status 

 June 18, 2014 - Version 0.0.2
 -----------------------------
 Experimental Phase
 ------------------
 0.0.2 - 6-18-14 - New branch created and wiki updated to show how version system works, HISTORY, BUGS, README, etc are created
 0.0.2 - 6-18-14 - Tests commencing for entire day, targeting Friday June 20 2014 for stable release status day (hopefully)
 0.0.2 - 6-19-14 - Testing (section generation generatesections)
 0.0.2 - 6-20-14 - Problems with xml validation and certain files in the boost library that have PHP integrated in the titles slow progress, new target 6-24-14
 0.0.2 - 6-21-14 - Scrapped original generatesections.sh, which worked with the file lists to generate and went back to off-machine design (paper + pencil)
 0.0.2 - 6-22-14 - The day was dedicated to the modular design and flowcharting the process, determined that dirwalking was far more stable than list walking
 0.0.2 - 6-23-14 - Applied concepts and design to new script, final testing phase succeeded, removed 80% of included documentation for speeding up tests for 6-24 release
 
 Stable Phase
 -----------------
 0.0.2 - 6-23-14 - After succeeding in compiling a working qch with contents, despite some issues (see BUGS), this version is deemed stable and the branch is solidified to release
 0.0.2 - 6-24-14 - fixed two bad date entries in HISTORY (was 6-24 and 6-25, supposed to be 6-23 and 6-24)

 June 25, 2014 - Version 0.0.3
 -----------------------------
 Experimental Phase
 ------------------
 0.0.3 - 6-24-14 - In this phase, targeting to polish what needs done, not just in BUGS list but also adding of KEYWORDS and (possibly) even FILTERS
 0.0.3 - 6-24-14 - Added import and mirror scripts. Signed project with a UUID, and secured readonly data (including UUID) with a sha256 checksum file  
                   Please note that the LICENSE is also hashed, to prevent accidental (or deliberate third party) modifications to the license.
									 Furthermore, only the LICENSE file should be considered, the other license headers (in varied files) are just there for reference
									 so you dont have to open LICENSE each time to read it. However, LICENSE is the legally applicable source in any circumstance, so
									 that is why it is protected with the SHA signature (it would be too much of a headache to do partial checksums for all license headers)
									 I *may* choose to remove the license headers later on, if need be. I should say *probably*.
 0.0.3 - 6-24-14 - Breaking from direct work on project in order to schedule 0.0.3's development cycle, and the when and where of it. This usually takes
 									 most of the day so I dont anticipate much actual project changes today (in exception to the ones made this morning, see above).
