 Compiling instructions:

 - to recreate the documentation, you must first destroy the generated files:

 		make clean

 - then re-create them:

    make

 - new step (introduced in 0.0.3) to import your own boost docs into the folder (this is actually symlinked, no copying is done)
	 note that the version distributed with the tree is not used in this case but it put in "HTML_OFFLINE" for safe keeping:

	 make myown

	 (this will call ./autoimport.sh prior to building, which will do the import, but it wont do it twice so dont worry about that)

 - The boost 1.54 documentation is included to show where the files must go

 - If you redistribute this you must redistribute everything included as per the
   license agreement (not charge for inclusion, etc)
