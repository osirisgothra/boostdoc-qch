		boostdoc qhp does not use index.htm files, if there are any make sure you rename them
		to index.html

		This file is kept here to remind you of that, and as a placeholder for the original
		boost documentation's index.htm which normally resides here.

		This file will be moved to .originals when autoimporting and replaced with the boost
		documentation's version of index.htm, but will still be unused because it is .htm and
		not .html (.htm is a bad remnant of the FAT days when files were limited to 8.3 chars)

		ALWAYS USE .html !!!!!
