 KNOWN ISSUES

 	Things that need fixed, things that have been fixed (affixed /w date), and things
	that cannot be fixed because either I don't know the root cause, or it just is not
	my problem in the first place (dependency or target).

qch-boostdoc Known Bugs

6/23/14 RESOLVED - Sections list not completed yet
- Keywords not completed yet (targeted for 0.0.3)
- Qt Creator will constantly try to reload if a tree's section is empty or it's children have no html
  while this is a QTH bug, we will try to insert "dummy" pages that act as a catch-all to avoid these
- Some pages have code in the titles, these are stripped out. Before I was going to blacklist these files
  but I know of only one so I kept it and just made sure all titles are valid and < 72 chars long
  if this is a problem for anyone contact me
- Some pages are redirectors, I haven't yet written the handlers to smart-link these items yet, this will
  be addressed in a future version, possible 0.0.3 or 0.0.4
	
ONGOING OR POSSIBLE ISSUES (that have not been fully verified or are ambiguous in nature)

- Some links may not be properly rewritten, if this is the case let me know
