KNOWN ISSUES
------------

- Keywords not completed yet (targeted for 0.0.3)
- Filters not completed yet (0.0.4)
- Advanced help features not completed =>0.0.4
- Qt Creator will constantly try to reload if a tree's section is empty or it's children have no html
  while this is a QTH bug, we will try to insert "dummy" pages that act as a catch-all to avoid these
- Some pages have code in the titles, these are stripped out. Before I was going to blacklist these files
  but I know of only one so I kept it and just made sure all titles are valid and < 72 chars long
  if this is a problem for anyone contact me
- Some pages are redirectors, I haven't yet written the handlers to smart-link these items yet, this will
  be addressed in a future version, possible 0.0.3 or 0.0.4 [UPDATE: in 0.0.3 for sure.]
- There are lots of pages (usually redirectors) that are titleless, mostly index pages, which is a problem
  and I will be addressing this issue in 0.0.3, to point to the first titled .html document
- Sections that contain several subsections w/o files before reaching one that does (is annoying)


RESOLVED ISSUES
---------------

- Sections list not completed yet [ resolved on June 23, 2014 (0.0.2-stable) ]

UNCONFIRMED ISSUES
------------------

OBSOLETE OR UNRESOLVABLE
------------------------
- Some links may not be properly rewritten, if this is the case let me know
  UPDATE: no longer rewriting links due to the fact that the project makes use of a user's own boost documentation
	        which should not be messed with at all, and is usually read only anyway (or it should be).
					Rewriting links was a trick used earlier in 0.0.1 to bypass some of the root pages, and an attempt to 
					shrink the tree. Since there are ~14k pages, this is really not for the best. Furthermore, the
					scripts 'rewritelinks' and 'rewrite-link' have been obolished for safetey's sake. You can however still
					have this if you download from 0.0.1 or 0.0.2 (but it is not used in 0.0.2).
						

If you would like to help, feel free to clone and then submit a merge request. Note that I wont always accept the entire
merge, I will have to weigh it with my own changes. Because of this, it is a good idea to contact me before making changes
that are large or major. Otherwise, feel free to start a fork featuring your own work on the project, merging as you see fit.

Read the README file for my contact information.
